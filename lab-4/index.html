         <p>
            <b>LAFEU</b>
         <blockquote>You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance.</blockquote>

         <p>
            <b>COUNTESS</b>
         <blockquote>This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that 'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so far, would have made nature immortal, and death should have play for lack of work. Would, for the king's sake, he were living! I think it would be the death of the king's disease.</blockquote>

         <p>
            <b>COUNTESS</b>
         <blockquote>He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.</blockquote>
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>LAFEU</b>
         <blockquote>He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge could be set up against mortality.</blockquote>

         <p>
            <b>COUNTESS</b>
         <blockquote>His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that her education promises; her dispositions she inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there commendations go with pity; they are virtues and traitors too; in her they are the better for their simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.</blockquote>

            <b>COUNTESS</b>
         <blockquote>'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. The remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it.</blockquote>

         <p>
            <b>COUNTESS</b>

         <p>
            <b>COUNTESS</b>
         <blockquote>Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father in manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy rather in power than use, and keep thy friend under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence, but never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will, that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord; 'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, advise him.</blockquote>

         <blockquote>O, were that all! I think not on my father; And these great tears grace his remembrance more than those I shed for him. What was he like? I have forgot him: my imagination carries no favour in't but Bertram's. I am undone: there is no living, none, if Bertram be away. 'Twere all one that I should love a bright particular star and think to wed it, he is so above me: In his bright radiance and collateral light must I be comforted, not in his sphere. The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: The hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague, to see him every hour; to sit and draw his arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, in our heart's table; heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour: But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?</blockquote>

         <p>
            <b>PAROLLES</b>
         <blockquote>Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. That you were made of is metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!</blockquote>
         </p>
         <p>
            <b>HELENA</b>

         <p>
            <b>PAROLLES</b>
         <blockquote>There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but lose by't: Out with 't! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!</blockquote>
         </p>
         <p>

         <p>
            <b>PAROLLES</b>
         <blockquote>Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not now. Your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek: and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our French wither'd pears; it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a wither'd pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a wither'd pear: will you any thing with it?</blockquote>

         <h2>Addendum</h2>
         <p style="font-style: italic;">
            For the presentation, I adopted ‘Segoe UI’ as the font and set ‘Tahoma’ and ‘Verdana’ 
            as their equivalents for better presentation over the different resolutions. 
            The headings are sized to have much contrast from each other: h2 is 28px for 
            the main section title and h3 is 24px for subtitles. The body text is set at 
            17px – larger than standard sizes – to enhance the work’s legibility. I opted 
            for a color scheme that combines professional tones with subtle highlights: body 
            text is at 333 level this increases read ability, the headings are at 2c3e50 level 
            for clear distinction of the body text, links are at 3498db and the hover state is 
            at a darker color level. The table background has that opposite color of blue in 
            light teal (#eaf7f7) which separates sections of the page. Margins and padding were 
            carefully chosen to give the layout breathing room: The four divisions have 20px 
            pillows around a body, and the article itself which is positioned centered has 40px 
            of space around it and 30px of inner padding to give the text enough breathing room 
            but enough focus. The deflection is added to the blockquotes as most of them 
            have padding for emphasis More interactivity was introduced where the articles 
            glide with a mild shadow on mouse over while links alter color.
